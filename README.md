The .bat is made with already available information online , And made in order to simplify the process of creating new Dword 32-bit values and creating new sub-keys in windows defender Registry in order to Disable Windows Defender permanentl.
Note that , disabling defender will make you system vulnerable, Do this only if you know what you are doing.
the .bat also creates a backup of your default settings of defender registry so just restore this if you want to re-enable windows defender.
